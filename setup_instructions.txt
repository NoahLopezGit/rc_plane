make RF24 library
    while in RF24 and desired computer run "Make" command
sudo make install - adds RF24 headers and libraries to /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/RF24
    I believe this step makes the library avaialable globally to the compiler
    to include RF24 library you would write #include <RF24/RF24.h>
